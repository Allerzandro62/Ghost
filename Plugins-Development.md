### This section is still under construction.

On this Wiki section, we'll provide the needed info to be able to create a custom plugin for `airgeddon`. The explanations will be based on an example plugin which is still under development.

A plugin creation template will be provided in order to ease the task.

This feature will be ready for the next v10.0

More information coming soon...

The plugins system is an ambitious feature to provide to users the ability to perform custom modifications to `airgeddon` in an easy and quick way. It is based in a "hook" system which can be used to override or hook functions with custom content to enhance or create custom features.

This is still under development. This feature will be ready for the next v10.0

More information coming soon...

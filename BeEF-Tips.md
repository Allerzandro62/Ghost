 - The right software you must install is **BeEF** (Browser Exploitation Framework). Be careful, do not mistake it with **beef** (Flexible Brainfuck Interpreter). This package has the same name and executable file name on some distributions and can lead into confusion. Anyway, `airgeddon` is able to detect the issue and display a warning if needed. Here is a link to the right [BeEF installation's page].

 - If you are using a distribution which already has BeEF installed like Kali, BlackArch or Wifislax, there will be no problems. If you have manually installed BeEF, `airgeddon` is able to manage the integration asking for the path where it's installed, even modifying its own code in order to make updates-proof persistent changes.
